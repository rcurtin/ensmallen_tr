\section{Static Assertions to Check Matrix Traits}
\label{sec:templated_optimize_details}

In Section~\ref{sec:templated_optimize}, we showed that {\tt ensmallen} uses
templates to allow arbitrary types to be used for the matrix type or gradient
type.
However, care must be taken there to avoid a drawback with C++ template metaprogramming,
which is the issue of compiler errors.
In Figure~\ref{fig:gd}, the compiler may fail to substitute a given {\tt MatType}
into the code for {\tt GradientDescent::Optimize()}. A~typical reason might be that
a required method of {\tt MatType} or {\tt FunctionType} is not available.
For example, the given {\tt MatType} does not have an {\tt operator\*()} method.
Ordinarily, current C++ compilers typically emit a long list of error messages,
with unnecessarily detailed and distracting information.
The internal framework in {\tt ensmallen} avoids this issue via the use of
C++ compile-time static assertions ({\tt static\_assert()}),
resulting in considerably clearer error messages.

The framework provides a set of utility methods for checking traits of {\tt
MatType} and {\tt GradType} (for differentiable objective functions) inside of
an optimizer's {\tt Optimize()} method:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt RequireFloatingPointType<MatType>()}: this requires that the
element type held by {\tt MatType} is either {\tt float} or {\tt double}.
This is generally needed by optimizers that use Armadillo functionality which
ends up calling LAPACK functions~\cite{anderson1999lapack}.

  \item {\tt RequireSameInternalTypes<Mat1Type, Mat2Type>()}: this requires that
{\tt Mat1Type} and {\tt Mat2Type} use the same type to hold elements.  This is
useful for differentiable optimizers, where the user is allowed to specify
different objective matrix types ({\tt MatType}) and gradient matrix types ({\tt
GradType}).  This function allows us to require that the same type (e.g., {\tt
int} or {\tt float} or {\tt double}) is used for both {\tt MatType} and {\tt
GradType}.

  \item {\tt RequireDenseFloatingPointType<MatType>()}: this requires that the
element type held by {\tt MatType} is either {\tt float} or {\tt double}, and
that the representation used for storage by {\tt MatType} is dense.
\end{itemize}

These methods would typically be called at the top of the implementation of an
optimizer's {\tt Optimize()} method.

At the time of writing, these are the only three checks that have
been needed, but it is easy to add more.  The implementation of these functions
is just a {\tt static\_assert()} that uses some underlying traits of the given
template parameters.  For example, Figure~\ref{fig:rsit} is the implementation
of {\tt RequireSameInternalTypes<...>()}.

Note that users who would like to continue despite these {\tt static\_assert()}
checks failing may simply define the macro {\tt ENS\_DISABLE\_TYPE\_CHECKS} in
their code before the line {\tt \#include <ensmallen.hpp>}.
