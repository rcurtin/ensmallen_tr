\section{Automatic function generation}
\label{sec:automatic}

In this section the goals are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce {\tt EvaluateWithGradient()} and the motivation for that
(logistic regression is a nice example).

  \item Point out that a user doesn't need to implement {\bf both} {\tt
Evaluate()} and {\tt EvaluateWithGradient()} but instead that we can
automatically infer one from the other {\it at compile time}.

  \item Discuss the general design of the template metaprogramming system that
makes this work.
\end{itemize}
