\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The problem of mathematical optimization is fundamental in the computational
sciences.  In short, this problem is expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{argmin}_x f(x).
\end{equation}

The ubiquity of this problem gives rise to the proliferation of mathematical
optimization toolkits, such as SciPy~\cite{2019arXiv190710121V},
opt++~\cite{meza1994opt++},
OR-Tools~\cite{ortools}, CVXOPT~\cite{vandenberghe2010cvxopt},
NLopt~\cite{johnson2014nlopt}, Ceres~\cite{ceres-solver},
and RBFOpt~\cite{costa2018rbfopt}.
Furthermore, in the field of machine learning, many
deep learning frameworks have integrated optimization
components.  Examples inclulde Theano~\cite{2016arXiv160502688},
TensorFlow~\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}, PyTorch~\cite{NEURIPS2019_9015},
and Caffe~\cite{jia2014caffe}.

Function optimization is generally quite computationally intensive.
For instance, the training of deep neural networks is dominated by
the optimization of the model parameters on the
data~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, lauzon2012introduction}.  Similarly,
other popular machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression are also
expressed as and dominated by an optimization process~\cite{zhang2004solving,
manogaran2018health}.  Computational bottlenecks occur even in fields as
wide-ranging as rocket landing guidance systems~\cite{dueri2016customized},
motivating the development and implementation of specialized solvers.

The necessity of efficient and specializable function optimization motivated us
to implement the C++ library {\tt ensmallen}, originally as a part of the {\tt
mlpack} machine learning library~\cite{mlpack2018}.  {\tt ensmallen} uses
template metaprogramming techniques~\cite{veldhuizen1998c++,
alexandrescu2001modern, abrahams2004c++} to produce efficient code during
compilation that can take advantage of special structure in the objective
function, while simultaneously providing a friendly and intuitive interface
that matches the ease of use of popular optimization toolkits like SciPy,
OR-Tools, and MATLAB's {\tt fminsearch()} function~\cite{matlab_fminsearch}.

% the 46 optimizers are as of 2.11.0
{\tt ensmallen} allows the user to define a function $f(x)$ to be optimized with
a wide variety of optimization techniques; at the time of this writing, 46
optimizers are available.  Many of these optimization techniques operate on
specific {\it classes} of objective functions---for instance, {\tt ensmallen}
contains many optimizers that work on differentiable functions, and so a user
must provide both $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ in this case.
Through template metaprogramming, {\tt ensmallen} allows the user to select
an arbitrary type for $x$ (e.g., dense floating-point matrix, sparse integer matrix, etc.).
Users may also specify custom behavior via customizable {\it callbacks}.
It is also easy to implement new optimization techniques employing the framework provided by {\tt ensmallen}.

% TODO: this will need to be refactored once the document is refactored
In this paper, we describe the details of these template metaprogramming
techniques and how we are able to simultaneously produce efficient code and a
clean user interface.  In Section~\ref{sec:api}, we introduce the functionality
and interface for {\tt ensmallen} with examples.
Section~\ref{sec:templated_optimize} is our first foray into template
metaprogramming, showing how {\tt ensmallen} can optimize objective functions
$f(x)$ for any type $x$ without any extra runtime overhead.
Section~\ref{sec:automatic} discusses the details of how {\tt ensmallen} is able
to automatically generate methods not provided by the user.
Section~\ref{sec:callbacks} describes {\tt ensmallen}'s callbacks.
We demonstrate the empirical efficiency of {\tt ensmallen} in
Section~\ref{sec:experiments} and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

This paper is an expanded description of {\tt ensmallen}'s original
introduction~\cite{ensmallen2018, curtin2017generic}, and provides a deep dive
into the internals of how the library works.  This means it can be a very useful
resource for anyone looking to contribute to the library or get involved with
its development.
