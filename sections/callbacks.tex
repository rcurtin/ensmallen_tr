\section{Callbacks}
\label{sec:callbacks}

The goals of this section are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce how callbacks are used with a simple example.

  \item List the callbacks we currently have support for.

  \item Give a simple example of how a user might implement a custom callback.

  \item Mention some of the C++ parts used in the callback implementation in
order to show that callbacks end up having no extra overhead.
\end{itemize}
