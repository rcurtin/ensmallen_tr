\section{Advanced Usage}

It is possible to do more than optimize a model that is stored as 
a dense matrix ({\tt arma::mat}).  Support is also provided for:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Inference of functions not supplied by the user.
For example, a user might supply a single function named
{\tt EvaluateWithGradient()}
in order to allow sharing common computation that may be 
present in {\tt Evaluate()} and {\tt Gradient()}.
For instance, the computation of $(\bm X \bm \theta - \bm y$)
in Equations~(\ref{eqn:obj_lr}) and~(\ref{eqn:grad_lr}) can be reused.
The two functions can then be automatically inferred when needed.

\item
Callbacks, which can specify custom behavior during the optimization.
Examples include printing the loss function value at each iteration,
terminating when a time limit is reached,
or other custom user-supplied functionality.

\item
Use of types other than {\tt arma::mat} when calling {\tt Optimize()}.
This can include
integer-valued matrices ({\tt arma::imat}),
sparse matrices ({\tt arma::sp\_mat}),
or any type whose implementation matches the Armadillo API.



\end{itemize}

Each of the above points is covered in more detail
in the following sections.

% The following sections discuss how we are able to achieve the
