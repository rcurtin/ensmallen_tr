\section{Advanced Usage}
\label{sec:advanced}

In addition to the support for various objective functions and
the provision of many pre-built optimizers covered in Section~\ref{sec:overview},
the {\tt ensmallen} library provides further functionality, suitable for advanced users.
This includes:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Inference of functions not supplied by the user.
For example, a user might supply a single function named
{\tt EvaluateWithGradient()}
in order to allow sharing common computation that may be 
present in {\tt Evaluate()} and {\tt Gradient()}.
For instance, the computation of $(\bm X \bm \theta - \bm y$)
in Equations~(\ref{eqn:obj_lr}) and~(\ref{eqn:grad_lr}) can be reused.
The two functions can then be automatically inferred when needed.

\item
Callbacks, which can specify custom behavior during the optimization.
Examples include printing the loss function value at each iteration,
terminating when a time limit is reached,
or other custom user-supplied functionality.

\item
Use of types other than {\tt arma::mat} when calling {\tt Optimize()}.
This can include
integer-valued matrices ({\tt arma::imat}),
sparse matrices ({\tt arma::sp\_mat}),
or any type whose implementation matches the Armadillo API.

\end{itemize}

Each of the above points is covered in more detail below.
