\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

This section is meant to describe the actual experimental speedups seen by
ensmallen.  We can use the previous two benchmarks from the ensmallen submission
to the NeurIPS workshop, and if we like, any more (but I don't feel like we
should feel obligated to do that).
