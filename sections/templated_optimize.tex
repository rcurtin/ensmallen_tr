\section{Type-agnostic optimization}
\label{sec:templated_optimize}

The goals of this section are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Highlight the function signature {\tt template<typename MatType> double
Optimize()}.

  \item Discuss the details of how templates get us speedup by effectively
producing specialized code at compile-time.

  \item Mention the types that {\tt Optimize()} will work with.

  \item Discuss the compile-time checks we added to warn when an unsupported
type is used?
\end{itemize}
