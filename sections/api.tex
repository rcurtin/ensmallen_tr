\section{API overview and examples}
\label{sec:api}

General goals of this section:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide a simple usage example for differentiable functions with
ensmallen (as an introduction).

  \item List the different types of objective functions that ensmallen can
optimize.  (and perhaps the requirements for each objective function type?)

  \item Compare ensmallen's functionality and flexibility to other libraries.

  \item List the different optimizers that ensmallen implements.

  \item Link to other resources: Mention that ensmallen is the optimization
toolkit used by mlpack, and link to the ensmallen website documentation.
\end{itemize}
