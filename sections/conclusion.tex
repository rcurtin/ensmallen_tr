\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This report introduces and explains {\tt ensmallen}, a C++ mathematical
optimization library that internally uses template metaprogramming to produce efficient
code.  The library is flexible, with support for numerous types of objective
functions, and many implemented optimizers.  It is easy to both implement
objective functions to optimize with {\tt ensmallen}, and to write new
optimizers for inclusion in the library.  {\tt ensmallen} has support for
automatic function inference and callbacks.  Because this is done through
template metaprogramming, there is no additional runtime overhead.
Empirical results show that {\tt ensmallen} outperforms other toolkits 
for similar tasks.

Future work includes the implementation of additional optimizers
and better support for various types of objective functions
(such as better support for constrained functions).
Development is done in an open manner at \mbox{\url{https://github.com/ensmallen/ensmallen}}.
The library uses the permissive BSD license~\cite{TODO} \TODO{citation}.
Anyone is welcome to help with the effort and contribute code.
