\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces and explains {\tt ensmallen}, a C++ mathematical
optimization library that uses template metaprogramming to produce efficient
code.  The library is flexible, with support for numerous types of objective
functions, and many implemented optimizers.  It is easy to both implement
objective functions to optimize with {\tt ensmallen}, and to write new
optimizers for inclusion in the library.  {\tt ensmallen} has support for
automatic function inference and callbacks.  Because this is done through
template metaprogramming, there is no additional runtime overhead.  Experimental
results show that {\tt ensmallen} outperforms other toolkits for similar
tasks---thus justifying the use of C++ and templates.

Expected future work with {\tt ensmallen} includes the implementation of
additional optimizers and better support for different types of objective
functions (such as better support for constrained functions).  Development is
done on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/ensmallen/ensmallen}; the library is
BSD-licensed, and anyone is welcome to contribute code and help with the effort.
